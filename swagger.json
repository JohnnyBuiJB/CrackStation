  description: |-
    CrackStation is a cryptography web service that supports cracking SHA hashes. The library takes an SHA hash as input, then search it in pre-computed look up table.
    
    Currently, the library only supports cracking SHA-1 or hashes of [A-Za-z0-9?!]{1,2,3} and unsalted passwords.
